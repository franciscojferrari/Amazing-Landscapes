# Amazing-Landscapes

This repository is a part of our master's course in Deep Learning in Data Science (DD2424) taken in Spring 2021 at KTH.
In this project, we aim to synthesize photorealistic images given a semantic layout input, being inspired by
this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07291). By reproducing this paper, we aim to grasp the idea behind
spatially-adaptive normalization (SPADE), the main theoretical contribution of the original paper; reimplement it using
TensorFlow,

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the requirements.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Training

* The training of the network can be found in Training and Testing notebook in the notebooks folder Amazing-Landscapes/notebooks/Training and Testing.ipynb
